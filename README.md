IoT Farm Irrigation System is an automated solution for
monitoring and controlling the water flow to crops based on their moisture levels. The
system aims to reduce water usage and optimize crop growth by ensuring that crops
are not over-watered or under-watered. This simulation environment aims to collect and analyze data from the system.
